# CI-CD-Pipelines
# Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application Deployment

This repository contains a fully automated **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline designed to streamline web application development, testing, and deployment processes using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**.

## Key Features:
- **Continuous Integration**: Automates testing, building, and integration processes using Jenkins.
- **Containerization**: Builds lightweight Docker images for easy deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploys the web application on Kubernetes clusters, ensuring smooth and scalable operations.

## Technologies Used:
- **Jenkins**: For setting up automated pipelines for CI/CD.
- **Docker**: To containerize applications, making them easily portable.
- **Kubernetes**: To manage and deploy containerized applications at scale.
- **GitHub**: For version control, enabling collaboration and continuous updates.

### Prerequisites:
To run this project, you need the following installed:
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud provider like GCP/AWS)

### How to Run the Pipeline:
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/CI-CD-Pipeline-Bytewise.git
   Configure Jenkins: Add your Docker credentials to Jenkins.
Run the Jenkins Pipeline: Jenkins will handle the restâ€”building, pushing, and deploying the app to Kubernetes.
